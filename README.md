# blog-app-serverless
*My RESTful Blog App*

I coded this app using ***NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB database*** following the ***RESTful API*** routing pattern. I styled it using **Semantic UI** library (which is an alternative to Bootstrap). This is a blog app where users can view, add, edit and delete blog posts.

I have deployed it using Serverless Framework on AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
